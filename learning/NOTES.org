* Notes
** Feature Selection
each feature is a predicate on parse trees
- presence of operator
- types of leaf nodes?
** Learning
*** linear model
62% acc with presence of operator
*** convolution neural net
52% acc with presence of operator
(unclear if i set it up properly)
*** wide-n-deep
would like to try, but can't get example working?
** Ideas
- maybe we shouldn't treat each subexpr as an individual feature vector
  - instead of classifying subexpr as good/bad independently
  - classify good/bad in context of other subexprs
** Implementation
*** Avoiding sampling bias
- unequal # of good/bad samples can produce misleading results, model
  has essentially learned constant function, but appears better
- select N good and bad samples
- then shuffle them together to ensure similar distribution per batch

* Todo
** TODO 8k bad/fix pairs, only 4k bad locations?
should be equal number...
** TODO fix "syntax error" checker, rerun data
** TODO add type of current / parent / child expr as features
