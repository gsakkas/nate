* Notes
** Feature Selection
each feature is a predicate on parse trees
- presence of operator
- types of leaf nodes?
** Learning
*** linear model
62% acc with presence of operator
*** convolution neural net
52% acc with presence of operator
(unclear if i set it up properly)
*** wide-n-deep
would like to try, but can't get example working?
** Ideas
- maybe we shouldn't treat each subexpr as an individual feature vector
  - instead of classifying subexpr as good/bad independently
  - classify good/bad in context of other subexprs
** Implementation
*** Avoiding sampling bias
- unequal # of good/bad samples can produce misleading results, model
  has essentially learned constant function, but appears better
- select N good and bad samples
- then shuffle them together to ensure similar distribution per batch

* Todo
** CANCELLED 8k bad/fix pairs, only 4k bad locations?

:LOGBOOK:
- State "CANCELLED"  from "TODO"       [2016-10-28 Fri 11:52]
:END:
should be equal number...
** DONE fix "syntax error" checker, rerun data
CLOSED: [2016-10-28 Fri 11:52]
** TODO add type of current / parent / child expr as features
** TODO add feature vectors of children (parent? sibling?)
zero-pad to widest expr node
** TODO add type info
plus whether expr is part of bad program slice
** TODO run queries on typed asts
- eg. how often do students match on functions

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let pipe fs =
  let f a z e x = x a in
  let base y = y in
  List.fold_left f base fs;;
#+END_SRC
** DONE make sure we can run nanomaly as a binary on arbitrary files
CLOSED: [2016-10-27 Thu 10:47]
- compare against ocaml/sherrloc
- when they fail, can nanomaly find a witness?
** TODO diff threshold                                                :ersp:
if diff encompasses >n% of original program, filter out
for different n, how many fixes exceed threshold
** DONE send RJ the algorithm M paper
CLOSED: [2016-10-27 Thu 10:47]
** TODO try adding *root* features to each vector (identify exprs by common prog)
** TODO can we predict *type* of expression
- features are ast-node + [is_int, is_bool, is_list, ...] for children (maybe + is_error?)
- labels are [is_int, is_bool, is_list, ...]
- linear classifier
- train classifier on fully annotated programs
- then predict in bottom up fashion on unannotated programs, propagating labels up into parent's features
** TODO: figure out meaningful error location from nanomaly
